# Spam Filter

An implementation of a Spam Filter in Python that uses the Naive Bayes Model to classify emails as spam or ham.
The program uses a small portion of NLTK to tokenize and clean out the "noise" words that may appear across the text.

The data sets were obtained from the SpamAssassin Public Corpus, which can be found [here](http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/)

### Program Demo:

Simply run the script 'Classi.py' :

  ``` 
  python Classi.py    
  ```

As the results will show, the classifier has roughly 90% success in distinguishing ham and spam from hard ham mails.

### Running the program:

```
python SpamClassifier.py
```
